# the_mindful_pomodoro

Looking to get in the zone in a mindful way? look no further â€“ The Mindful Pomodoro has all you need! Including, but not limited to:

- A set 25 minute 'focus' period
- A 5 minute rest period which can be extended by a further 5 minutes (as many times as you like xD)
- A timer alarm and alert that informs you when your 25 minutes has passed, as well as when your rest interval is over.
