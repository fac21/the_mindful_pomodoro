# the_mindful_pomodoro

Looking to get in the zone in a mindful way? look no further ‚Äì The Mindful Pomodoro has all you need! Including, but not limited to...

## Design and features

- A sleek, simple user interface to get you feeling mindful and 'in the zone'
- A set 25 minute 'focus' period
- A 'breathe' function for pausing the timer
- A 'reset' function that allows you to reset the timer
- A 5 minute rest period which can be extended by a further 5 minutes (as many times as you like xD)
- A timer alarm and alert that informs you when your 25 minutes has passed, as well as when your rest interval is over.

## Building the timer

A really cool, fun, novel, and challenging exprience! It was my favourite part of the pre-course assignment and it felt good to be using good ol' Vanilla JS again, after a brief respite, seeing as though we had prevously been handed challenges focusing more on CSS and HTML.

My ideas for this timer were pretty bold to begin with. I was hoping to incororate some of Oli's 'stretch goals', which, to some degree, I did do. But, unfortunately, I haven't made the 'focus' timer function changeable, meaning it is only set to countdown from 25 minutes. The 'rest' timer is slgightly more flexible: it alerts the user when 5 minutes has passed, but they have the option following this to rest for another 5 minutes every time it finishes. They also have the option to 'reset' the timer all over again if they wish, which allows them to start another 25 minute focus period. 

In the end, after stuggling with trying to incorporate 'forms' into the HTML/JS to have the user enter the timer period they wished for, I decided to just overhaul everything and make it as short, sweet, and simle as possible ‚Äì both in design and in features. And hence ‚Äì The Mindful Pomodoro was born!

In terms of the code I wrote, I wrote one main function for the timer:

```
function pomodoro(){
    //Focus time countdown

    if(focusSecs.innerText != 0){
        focusSecs.innerText--;
    } else if(focusMins.innerText != 0 && focusSecs.innerText == 0){
        focusSecs.innerText = 59;
        focusMins.innerText--;
}

if (focusSecs.innerText < 10 && focusSecs.innerText > 0) {
    focusSecs.innerText = "0" + focusSecs.innerText;
}

if (focusMins.innerText == 0 && focusSecs.innerText == 0 && restMins.innerText == 5 && restSecs.innerText == "00") {
        alarm.play();
        alert("You're totally in the zone! Click OK to take a 5 minute rest üßò");

}

```

Once these conditions are met, the alarm and alert are executed (see above). Following this, I run pretty much the same conditions for the rest timer or 'restSecs' ‚Äì which is still part of the same function:

```
  if(focusMins.innerText == 0 && focusSecs.innerText == 0){
      if(restSecs.innerText != 0){
          restSecs.innerText--;
      } else if(restMins.innerText != 0 && restSecs.innerText == 0){
          restSecs.innerText = 59;
          restMins.innerText--;
          }  
          
        if (restSecs.innerText < 10 && restSecs.innerText > 0) {
          restSecs.innerText = "0" + restSecs.innerText;
      } else if (restMins.innerText ==  0 && restSecs.innerText == 0)  {
 alarm.play();
 alert("You're all Zenned out! Click OK to rest for 5 more minutes. OR, press reset to restart the timer! üôè")
 restMins.innerText = 5;
}
 }
  }
```

You may be wondering why I reset the 'restMins' to 5 mins upin completing the timer ‚Äì won't that just invoke the alert that pops up after the first 'focus' time is completed? No. Why? because when the timer(s) countdown to 0, it does not match the initial condition of 00. See the following lines of code as a demonstration:

```
focusMins === 0 && focusSecs ===0 and restMins === 5 && restSecs === "00";
```

Notice (crucially) that it is checking if resSecs are equal to 0 rather than 00. Ths means that when both the focus time and rest time periods are up, the user can then either press 'breathe' to pause the timer or 'reset' to to reset the timer without being harassed by the alarm and alert that are activated when the focus time is up. This also comes with the advantage of giving the user the flexibility to prolong their rest time by another 5 minutes automatically. They can do this as many times as they like. The only caveat is that they will be alerted that ther rest period is up every 5 minutes (which is *technically* a good thing considering this is a productvity app!)

There is also another piece of code related to the above code, see here:

```
if (focusSecs.innerText < 10 && focusSecs.innerText > 0) {
    focusSecs.innerText = "0" + focusSecs.innerText;
}
```

I originally wrote the above code because I didn't like that the seconds counted down straight from 10 to 9 rather than 10 to '09'. In the end, it became quite an important part of the function. Why? primarily because it looks a lot better! But, also, because when the 5 minutes rest interval is up, the function automatically re-runs again straight from the point where the 5 minutes rest timer starts (after the user clicks 'OK' to the alert) ‚Äì just in case the user wants another 5 minutes rest. 

This is why I only reset the minutes rather than the seconds after the rest timer is completed ‚Äì as it technically starts counting down from '5:0' rather than the '5:00''. If this wasn't the case, the user would get the same alert that they got when the first 'focus' time had run. Nifty, heh?

There were other ways I could have improved this app and the code I'd written. But given the nature of the assignment and the time period, this seemed a good way to go, and it's personally everything I would want from a pomodoro timer... (not that *I'm* biased or anything!)


## What I learned

I learned more about the 'innerText' feature of JavaScript, having only used 'innerHTML' previously. I also feel as though I further solidified my knowledge of DOM manipulation. In addition, I learned how to incoprorate 'setInterval()' and 'clearInterval()' functions ‚Äì neither of which I had previously come across. In all honesty, it was a fairly challenging exericse, but, fortunately, it wasn't *too* challenging. I perhaps tried to challenge myself too much oirignally by wanting to make the user have full flexibility over their input times for focus and rest periods. So, one thing I learned by attempting to do this is that forms can be a bit of a pain to use, as it added a real layer of complexity that my final solution doesn't have! 

I realise that my eventual project is pretty primitive, but it does all the things it was set out to achieve. So I'm pretty pleased with the end result as well as the main points covered and learned throughout the project.
